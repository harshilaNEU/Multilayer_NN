## Task 1: Develop a Multilayer Neural Network

Develop a multilayer (deep) neural networks for binary classification problem according to the following specification.

Model: (10/ReLU) – (8/ReLU)² – (4/ReLU) – (1/Sigmoid)

The specification above means the following:

layer 1 with 10 neurons and ReLU activation function
layers 2 and 3 (2 layers shown as power 2 in the spec) with 8 neurons per each layer and ReLU activation function
layer 4 with 4 neurons and ReLU activation function
one (last) layer 5 with one neuron and Sigmoid activation function

## OUTPUT

Model: (10/ReLU) – (8/ReLU)² – (4/ReLU) – (1/Sigmoid)
